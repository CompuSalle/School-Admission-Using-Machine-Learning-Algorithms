### Dataset Downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)


Abstract â€“ The dataset titled "Predicting Graduate
School Admission" presents a repository of valuable
information gathered from a pool of applicants to
graduate programs spanning various universities. The
primary aim of this dataset is to develop a predictive
model that can accurately forecast the probability of
each student applicant's admission. The dataset
incorporates several pertinent variables, including GRE
scores, GPAs, and undergraduate institution rank, which
can be employed to train and validate the predictive
model. The predictive model's efficacy is influenced by
the thorough selection and analysis of these variables,
which play a pivotal role in the graduate admission
decision-making process.
